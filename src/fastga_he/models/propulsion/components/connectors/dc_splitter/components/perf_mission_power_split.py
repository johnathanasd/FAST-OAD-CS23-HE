    Component which takes the desired power split for the splitter operation from the data and
    gives it the right format for the mission. It was deemed best to put it this way rather than
    the original way to simplify the construction of the power train file.

    The input power split can either be a float (then during the whole mission the power split is
    going to be the same) or an array of number of points elements for the individual control of
    each point.

    Computation of the weight of the tank. The very simplistic approach we will use is to say
    that weight of tank is the weight of unused fuel. Usually the tank weight is included in the
    fuel systems as well as pipes, pumps, ... Since we can't reuse those formula, and since we
    don't have an analytical formula to compute it we will use this simplified approach.
